<p>Flood waters can damage or destroy animal shelters, if so they would have to be replaced, costing time and resources.</p>
<p>Standing water in the animal shelter can also be dangerous for the animals. Polluted, stagnant flood waters can carry diseases that can be deadly for the animals if they drink the water, or if they have open wounds. Standing in water for extended times can cause various problems on the animals feet and legs, leading to debilitating injury and/or death.</p>
<p>Look for damage to the shelter and water in and around the shelter, as in the following examples:</p>
