<p>In this question we are asking you to identify the animal that you are looking at. Livestock are an important asset that provide food, transport, and labour as work animals in agriculture. Their loss through flooding or associated disease can significantly affect livelihoods and have a flow on effect on the local economy.</p>
<p>With this application we want to collect data on what types of animals are in the area and whether or not they were affected by the flooding.</p>

<h3>How can I work out what animal I am looking at?</h3>
<p>Identifying the species of animal you are looking at from just a photo can be difficult. However there are a lot of resources available on the internet to help you. In the project we have provided the most likely possibilities for the region in which you are working according to the animals most likely to be found in that area. Have a look at the different examples and compare them with the photo you are looking at. If one seems to match, click on the "More examples" link under the thumbnail. This will take you to a google search for the animal, from where you can begin looking for more photos and information about it to confirm your identification.</p>
<p>If you think the animal you are looking at is not in the examples given, try looking for lists of livestock for the region or country you are working on. Under the "Other" box there should be a link to a document on the relevant agricultural sector, you can start your search from here.</p>
<p>When searching on the internet for more information, try keywords such as "agriculture", "livestock", the name of the country in which you are working. Look for the relevant country's agricultural department (or similar), and work done by NGO's, or organisations like the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). These organisations often have inventories or reports on the agricultural activities within a particular country.</p>
<p>Identifying an animal can often take some time, so don't get discouraged if you feel it is taking too long! And if you are stuck you can always click the "I DON'T KNOW" button and move onto the next question.</p>
