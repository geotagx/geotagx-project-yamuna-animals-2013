<p>In this question we want to identify any animals that have died. They may or may not have died as a result of the flooding or resulting diseases however if there are a lot of dead animals in a particular area this would be of interest. Significant numbers of dead livestock can have a negative effect on their owner's livelihood, and a flow-on negative effect on the local economy.</p>
<p>Aside from the loss of livelihood associated with the loss of animals, carcases of animals lying in the streets or near water bodies can also be a threat to public health.</p>
<p>Click "No" if the animal you see in the photo is dead:</p>
